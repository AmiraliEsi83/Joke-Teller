# Joke-Teller
This app will tell you a joke when you need it the most. Sometimes is so not funny that you end up laughing anyway.
Based on HTML, CSS, JS and 2 APIs - Joke API and Voice RSS Text-To-Speech API.

Upon clicking on a button GET request is sent to the Joke API resulting in a received JSON object with a joke string.
Joke is sent via the POST request to the Voice RSS Text-To-Speech API.
A response is received as an audio and inserted into the audio HTML element which is hidden.
Finally the robot is telling user a joke.
